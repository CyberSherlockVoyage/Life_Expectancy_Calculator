# Life_Expectancy_Calculator
Welcome to the Life Expectancy Calculator, a simple Python script that estimates the number of days, weeks, and months you have left to live based on your current age, If you live to be 90 years old!

## About

This Python script is a fun and thought-provoking project that calculates an estimate of your remaining lifespan based on the assumption that the average human life expectancy is 90 years. It provides a rough estimate of how much time you have left in days, weeks, and months to help you appreciate the value of time.

## What You Can Learn

   - Learn how to create and structure Python scripts.
   - Explore the use of variables, data input, and mathematical operations in Python.

### 2. User Input Handling
   - Understand how to prompt users for input and capture their responses.
   - Learn to validate and process user-provided data.

### 3. Mathematical Calculations
   - Practice performing mathematical calculations in Python, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Explore how to apply mathematical formulas in real-world scenarios.

### 4. Git and Version Control
   - Learn how to use Git for version control by cloning and managing a Git repository.
   - Understand the basics of committing and pushing changes to a remote repository.

### 5. Documentation
   - Practice documenting your code using comments and creating a comprehensive README.md file.

## Key Features

### 1. Age Calculation
   - The project calculates the number of years you have left until you reach the assumed life expectancy of 90 years.

### 2. Time Conversion
   - It further breaks down the remaining time into months, weeks, and days, providing a comprehensive estimate.

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
   - The script guides users by prompting them to enter their age and then displays the results in a clear and understandable format.

### 4. Open Source
   - This project is open-source, allowing you to explore, modify, and share it with the programming community.

### 5. Educational
   - The project serves as an educational tool, helping you apply your programming skills to a practical scenario.


## How it Works
- When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter your current age.

- The script will then calculate the number of years you have left until you reach the age of 90 (the assumed life expectancy).

- It will further break down this time into months, weeks, and days.

- Finally, it will display the results, providing you with an estimate of how much time you have left to make the most of your life.

## Example

Input Example:
```
What is your current age? 30
```

In this input example, the user enters their current age as 30 years old.

Output Example:
```
You have 21,900 days, 3,120 weeks, and 720 months left to live.
```

In this output example, the script calculates the user's remaining lifespan based on the assumption that the average human life expectancy is 90 years. It then provides the estimated time left in days, weeks, and months.

## Usage
1. Enter your current age when prompted.

2. The script will output the estimated time you have left to live.

### You can also :
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the script in a Python environment:
